              Argentina’s winning goal at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro
              came in the 22nd minute after Rodrigo de Paul made a long pass to
              Angel di Maria. The 33-year-old veteran striker counted on some
              sloppy defending from left-back Renan Lodi to take control and lob
              it past goalkeeper Ederson. It was only the third goal Brazil
              conceded in the tournament. Neymar tried hard with dribbles.
